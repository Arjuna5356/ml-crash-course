## What’s in the Box?
### `topics/` - Your ML Spellbook
10 lessons to turn you from “What’s ML?” to “I’m unstoppable!”
1. **Intro to ML**: Predict stuff like a toddler with a calculator. (Code: Linear regression basics)
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data like a superhero janitor. (Code: Scaling magic)
3. **Regression**: Guess numbers—house prices, anyone? (Code: Linear regression)
4. **Classification**: Sort cats from dogs, or fails from passes. (Code: Logistic regression)
5. **Decision Trees**: Flowcharts for data nerds. (Code: Fruit classifier)
6. **Random Forests**: Trees that vote—democracy rules! (Code: Sleepy or awake?)
7. **Clustering**: Group stuff blindfolded. (Code: K-Means chaos)
8. **PCA**: Shrink data, keep the juice. (Code: Dimensionality reduction)
9. **Neural Networks**: Baby’s first digital brain. (Code: Tiny NN)
10. **Evaluation**: Grade your model—harsh but fair. (Code: Accuracy check)

### `projects/` - Your ML Playground
5 epic quests to prove your skills:
1. **Iris Classifier**: Guess flower species—botany meets ML! (Dataset: Iris, Random Forest)
2. **House Price Predictor**: Predict prices like a real estate rockstar. (Dataset: Synthetic, Linear Regression)
3. **Digit Recognizer**: Read scribbles—OCR vibes! (Dataset: Digits, Neural Net)
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Herd customers like a data cowboy. (Dataset: Synthetic, K-Means)
5. **Spam Detector**: Smack down spam emails. (Dataset: Synthetic, Naive Bayes)

## How to Unleash the Beast
1. **Clone It**: `git clone <your-repo-url>`—yoink!
2. **Install Potions**: `pip install scikit-learn tensorflow numpy`
3. **Run the Magic**: Open a file (e.g., `python topics/01_intro_to_ml.py`) and watch it go!
